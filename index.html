                        Born in Kurra Chittarpur, a small village near Agra, Uttar Pradesh, my father's story began in dust and 
                        heat. His father sold small cosmetics from a wooden cart—bindis, bracelets, trinkets—pushing it through 
                        village lanes while Papa and his younger brother walked beside him.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        They lived in a house with mud walls and a roof that leaked when monsoons came. One room served as 
                        bedroom, living room, and storage. The kitchen was an open balcony with a clay chulha. Water had to be 
                        carried in brass vessels from the community well. At age ten, he carried firewood twice his weight, 
                        gathered cow-dung cakes for fuel, cut leftover stalks for the cooking fire.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        But inside that small space, there was warmth. Laughter that echoed off walls. Stories told by lantern light. 
                        The smell of burning wood mixed with temple bells in the distance. Years later, he would say: "We didn't know 
                        we were poor. We only knew we were together."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        His elder brother Om Prakash and his wife Beena Jain (Taiji) became his greatest teachers. She taught him to 
                        cook, to read carefully, to keep his clothes clean even without running water. She would say, "Always do your 
                        work with your whole heart." Those words became his compass. She showed him that a person's worth isn't 
                        measured by what they own, but by how completely they give themselves to each moment.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            At age 14, a motorcycle accident nearly killed him—the handlebar pierced through his chest. He survived, 
                            and learned life was fragile. To pay for his ITI diploma in Radio Mechanics, he worked relentlessly: 
                            sold newspapers and magazines (3 AM-6 AM, cycling 15 km to collect them), installed TVs, sold vegetable 
                            puffs and biscuits outside schools. At his peak, he handled 7 magazines and 13 newspapers—seventeen hours 
                            of work, seven days a week, for years. When asked "Isn't this too much?", he would smile and say, 
                            "If I rest, who will work?"
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The appointment letter arrived from the India Meteorological Department. Position: Radio Mechanic, 
                            Lucknow. Every 3 AM bicycle ride, every hour of exhaustion, every day of uncertainty had led to this. 
                            A government job. Steady income. Security. Taiji's eyes filled with tears: "Your hard work paid off. 
                            I always knew it would." He quietly promised: "I won't let you down."

                        <p>
                            He married Anita, who came from a well-off family but chose him for his character, not his wealth. 
                            He owned nothing—no house, no land, just modest salary. They lived in one tiny room. But he made a 
                            promise: "I will give her a life better than the one I had." For nearly a year, he worked two jobs—
                            government job during the day, then 2 AM-6 AM distributing newspapers at night while she slept. 
                            On January 3, 1993, during a rainstorm, twin sons were born—Abhilash and Avinash.

                            Promoted to Radio Mechanic through departmental examination—earned through dedication, not connections. 
                            He became known as the reliable one, the person you could count on. Punctual, diligent, willing to take 
                            on tasks others avoided.

                            After 36 years of dedicated service, he retires with the quiet satisfaction of a life well-lived. 
                            He gave his best every single day, mentored colleagues, solved impossible problems, and never 
                            compromised his principles. But his work doesn't end—he still wakes at 4 AM to feed street animals, 
                            still helps families in need, still leads his community. As he once said about second chances: 
                            when you survive what should have killed you, every morning becomes a debt you owe the universe—
                            and he chose to repay it in kindness.

                    From barefoot village boy carrying firewood, to cycling through darkness at 3 AM selling newspapers, 
                    to 36 years at IMD—his journey wasn't about titles or wealth. It was about showing up. About doing your 
                    work with your whole heart. About never forgetting where you came from, and using every second chance to 
                    give back. The boy who survived the handlebar through his chest at 14, who was saved by a mysterious old man 
                    in white on an empty road at 4 AM, never forgot that his life was a gift. And such gifts demand purpose.

                        for personal gain. His word was his bond, and his principles were non-negotiable. 
                        That's a rare kind of strength.

                        For more than 30 years, he has fed street animals every single morning and evening. Rain or shine, 
                        festival or fever, he never missed a day. They know him—the man who shows up, whose kindness has no 
                        audience. He speaks little to them, but they wait for him. That simple act, repeated thousands of times, 
                        teaches more about faith than any sermon. As he once said when asked why he went out in harsh winter: 
                        "They have no one else. If we don't show up, who will?"

                        He distributes blankets to the homeless in winter, ensuring warmth reaches those who sleep in cold darkness. 
                        He helps families with education and medical expenses, never asking for repayment or recognition. He built a 
                        house with his own hands, watched it collapse in the rain, then rebuilt it again—because perseverance is his 
                        nature. A rickshaw puller once helped him after an accident and refused payment. That simple act of kindness 
                        became his life's template—he decided to become the grace he had witnessed, paying forward what he could never 
                        pay back.

                        Once, during harsh winter, I asked why he still went out every morning at dawn to feed 
                        the street animals. He simply said, "They have no one else. If we don't show up, who will?" 
                        That's my father—never loud, never boastful, just quietly doing what needs to be done.

                        to live with purpose and love.

                        <h3>The Sacrifices We Didn't See</h3>
                        <p>
                            We didn't know, as children, that Papa worked two jobs the year we were born. We didn't know he cycled 
                            through dark streets at 2 AM while we slept safely in our mother's arms. We didn't know that the foundation 
                            of our life—the security we took for granted—was built on his sleepless nights. We just knew he was always there. 
                            Always steady. Always smiling.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            He was 28 years old when we were born—twin sons on January 3, 1993, in the middle of a rainstorm. Already 
                            responsible for a wife, two premature babies, and a future that felt impossibly heavy. But he never faltered. 
                            He worked from a tiny one-room apartment, saved every rupee, and made my mother a quiet promise: I will give 
                            you a life better than the one I had. He fought for our admission to better schools. He watched us grow, 
                            pursue education, leave for distant cities—and never once asked us to stay.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Lessons Lived Daily</h3>
                        <p>
                            He didn't lecture us—he showed us. Waking up at 4 AM wasn't a sermon about discipline; it was his daily 
                            routine to feed animals who depended on him. Honesty wasn't an abstract value; it was him returning extra 
                            change to shopkeepers. Kindness wasn't words; it was 30+ years of feeding hungry creatures before feeding himself. 
                            When a rickshaw puller helped him after his accident and refused payment, Papa decided that's who he would become.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            He taught us that real strength is quiet. That every life saved demands purpose—when you survive what should 
                            have killed you (the handlebar at 14, the old man who appeared on an empty road at 4 AM), you owe the universe. 
                            He chose to repay that debt in kindness, in showing up, in being the person others could depend on. His life 
                            wasn't about what he accumulated—it was about what he gave away.

                            find blankets in winter, where broken things get rebuilt, where promises are kept in silence. For over 
                            30 years, through rain and illness, he has shown up for those who cannot thank him. That's not just love. 
                            That's legacy written in footsteps heard only by those who wait in darkness."

                    <p>
                        This was Taiji's teaching, and it became his compass. Whether carrying firewood at age 10, cycling 15 km 
                        at 3 AM to collect newspapers, or repairing radios at IMD—he gave his complete effort. When asked if he 
                        ever regretted his struggles, he said: "I never regretted anything. Whatever I did, I did with my whole heart." 
                        That's not just work ethic—it's a philosophy of life.

                    <h3>Grace Exists Everywhere—Become It</h3>
                    <p>
                        A rickshaw puller who asked for nothing showed him that the poorest can have the richest hearts. 
                        A doctor who worked through the night showed him dedication. An old man in white who may or may not 
                        have been real saved his life. He saw grace everywhere—and decided to become it himself. That's why, 
                        for 30+ years, he feeds animals daily. Why he helps without being asked.

                    <p>
                        He survived a handlebar piercing his chest at 14. He survived a night when a mysterious figure in white 
                        appeared and turned him back—the exact road where a fatal accident occurred minutes later. These weren't 
                        coincidences—they were grace. When you survive what should have killed you, every morning becomes a debt 
                        you owe the universe. He chose to repay it in kindness, in service, in showing up for those who have no one else.

                        Written at 3 AM—the hour you wake to feed the animals who wait for you

                    <p class="tribute-opening">
                        Dear Papa,
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        We are writing this at 3 AM—the sacred hour that belongs to you. While the world sleeps, you rise to feed 
                        the animals who recognize your footsteps in darkness. The same hour you once cycled through empty streets with 
                        newspapers and dreams heavy on your shoulders. This is the hour when heroes are made in silence.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Today, as you retire after 36 years at the India Meteorological Department, we witness a miracle. The barefoot 
                        boy from Kurra Chittarpur who carried firewood transformed into a father who carried families, a guardian to 
                        creatures who cannot speak but know his love. From ashes, you built a legacy not of wealth, but of worth.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        At 14, a handlebar pierced your chest—it should have been your end. Instead, it became a second chapter. You worked 
                        17-hour days as a teenager, cycled 15 kilometers at 3 AM to collect newspapers. When we asked why you never stopped, 
                        your answer broke our hearts: "If I rest, who will work?" You were a child raising himself, a boy building the man 
                        we would call our hero.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You married a woman who saw the diamond beneath the dust. She chose character over comfort. The year we were born, 
                        you worked two jobs—government by day, newspapers by night. At 28, with twin babies in one cramped room, most men 
                        would have crumbled. You simply rose at 3 AM and pedaled into darkness again. That's unconditional love embodied.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        For 30+ years, you've fed street animals every single day—through monsoons, fevers, festivals. You distribute 
                        blankets to the homeless in winter. You built a house with your hands, watched it collapse, then rebuilt it. 
                        This is holiness in work boots, grace cycling through darkness toward dawn.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        A rickshaw puller once saved you, refusing payment. An old man in white turned you back from a road where death 
                        waited minutes later. You called it grace, a second chance you chose to honor through service. Every animal you feed is 
                        a prayer of gratitude. Every person you help is interest on that grace.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Taiji taught you: "Do your work with your whole heart." When we asked if you ever regretted your struggles, you 
                        said: "I never regretted anything. Whatever I did, I did with my whole heart." You didn't just endure life—you 
                        embraced it. You transformed hardship into meaning. That's a life lived so truthfully that regret has no place to root.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        We grew up taking your presence for granted—steady as sunrise, reliable as breath. But sitting here at 3 AM, we 
                        finally see it: we spent our lives in the presence of quiet heroism. We were raised by a man who turned suffering 
                        into service, second chances into a legacy of light.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Men like you don't retire from who they are. Tomorrow you'll still wake at 3 AM. The animals will still hear your 
                        footsteps. Because service isn't something you do—it's oxygen to your soul. This isn't an ending. This is you 
                        finally serving on your own terms, answerable only to your magnificent heart.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="tribute-closing">
                        Thank you for being the father who carried worlds on a bicycle. Thank you for showing us that strength doesn't

                        when no one is watching. We see you now, Papa. We honor you. We celebrate you. And we love you with a depth
